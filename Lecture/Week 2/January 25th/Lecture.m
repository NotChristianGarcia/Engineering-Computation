Linear Systems of Equations
    This shit is important yo, it's basically in everything.
    1. ax = b
       a1x + b1y = c
       a2x + b2y = c
    2. Another example with matrices, it's impossible, ahhhh.
Matrices
    A(n,m) = [a11.....a1m; a21......a2m;..........; an1.....anm]
        n = number of row
        m = number of column
    Definitions
        n = to only 1
            A1m = [a11.....a1m]
            This is a a row matrix (row vector).
